# MtgTopDecks

Welcome to Mtg: Top Decks. This is a CLI based gem that gathers information on current top performing decks for Magic: the Gathering, the trading card game. Users will select a metagame of their interest to see a list of the last ten competitive events for that metagame. The user can then select an event to see the top decks for that event. The user can then select a deck to view a decklist to see which cards were played.
